Back from seeing 'Star Trek' and 'Night at the Museum.' 'Star Trek' was amazing, but 'Night at the Museum' was; eh.
It is a shame about GM. What if they are forced to make only cars the White House THINKS will sell? What do you think?
As u may have noticed, not too happy about the GM situation, nor AIG, Lehman, et al

RT @sportsguy33 The upside to Time Warner: unhelpful phone operators   superslow on-site service. Crap, that's not an upside.
RT @sportsguy33: New Time Warner slogan: "Time Warner, where we make you long for the days before cable."
confirmed: it's Time Warner's fault, not Facebook's, that fb is taking about 3 minutes to load. so tempted to switch to verizon =/
@sportsguy33 Time Warner = epic fail
I know. How sad is that?  RT @caseymercier: 1st day of hurricane season. That's less scarey than govt taking over GM.

I just created my first LaTeX file from scratch. That didn't work out very well. (See @amandabittner , it's a great time waster)
On that note, I hate Word. I hate Pages. I hate LaTeX. There, I said it. I hate LaTeX. All you TEXN3RDS can come kill me now.
Trouble in Iran, I see. Hmm. Iran. Iran so far away. #flockofseagullsweregeopoliticallycorrect
Reading the tweets coming out of Iran... The whole thing is terrifying and incredibly sad...
